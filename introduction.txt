Introduction
PHASE (Physics Handling and Simulation Engine) is a 2D physics engine that can simulate physics for a variety of applications. Its modularity will allow it to be easily inserted into other programs. We will be developing a user interface that acts as an editor to use and test the engine, and the physics engine module will be placed in the editor program. PHASE will include an easy-to-use editor that will allow the user to test the engine by inserting various physics objects into a display window. 
Some objects PHASE will be able to simulate are squares and circles. Our secondary goals are for the engine to be able to simulate complex objects like chains and springs. The modularity of the engine will allow it to be placed and used in other applications, such as a full-blown game engine or physics simulator. 
The engine will be written in C++ or C#, and the editor will be written in C++, C#, and/or Python, depending on functionality of the engine. The engine will utilize a multithreaded environment to optimize physics calculations. The optimized threading and calculations will allow the engine to be simulated in real time, making it suitable for applications that require user input during the simulation, like game engines. Another feature of the engine is that it will provide shader functionalities. The meshes can be textured and animated to enhance the simulation visuals.
This project is intended to be used for educational purposes. It will be open source, allowing full visibility of all the code. This tool should be useful in educational and personal projects, and provide learning experiences and opportunities.
