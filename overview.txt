PHASE is a physics engine module that can be used in any C++ program. The module is used by creating an object of the PhaseEngine class. Calling .Run() will start the physics simulation on a separate thread. The PhaseEngine has an interface of functions to interact with the simulation, so all thread safety is managed internally. Among the interface functions are functions to create objects, delete objects, and modify the objects' position, rotation, and velocity. The object in the physics simulations are represented by objects of the class GameObject. The GameObject has a Collider class that tells the physics engine the objects position, rotation, velocity, and vertices. The objects are stored in an ObjectBuffer class contained by the PhaseEngine. The ObjectBuffer contains a custom iterator that iterates over the objects in the buffer. This iterator is used by the external program do read gameobject data. The ObjectBuffer has two buffer arrays. One buffer is the read buffer. The objects in this buffer are read by the external program. The other buffer is the write buffer, and the PhaseEngine writes to this buffer internally when updating object data. It updates the object data with the results from the physics calculations and changes enqueued externally. The ObjectBuffer has a function that is called by the PhaseEngine that applies the changes to the write buffer to the read buffer. It does this by acquiring a unique write lock on the mutex and swapping the pointers to the read and write buffers. It then releases the unique lock and acquires a shared read lock and copies the data in the new read buffer to the new write buffer. The end result is the read buffer is now identical to the write buffer. The physics loop swaps buffers, runs the physics calculations, and then applies the enqueued changes.
